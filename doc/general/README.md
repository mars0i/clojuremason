General notes on Clojure, MASON, and ABMs
====

These documents don't concern the masonclj library per se, though
they do provide rationales for some of the design choices assumed by
masonclj.  These notes might be useful for anyone interested in using
MASON with Clojure, or interested in writing ABMs in Clojure.  Some of
the notes are about Clojure-Java interop, and might be useful to a wider
audience.

NOTE: "Agent" in these documents refers to agents in the agent-based
modeling sense.  This sense of the term has almost nothing to do
with the Clojure language agent concept.
