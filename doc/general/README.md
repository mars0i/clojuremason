General notes on Clojure, MASON, and ABMs
====

These documents don't concern the masonclj library per se.  They might
be useful for anyone interested in using MASON with Clojure, or
interested in writing ABMs in Clojure.  Some of the notes are about
Clojure-Java interop, and might be useful to a wider audience.  However,
these notes provide rationales for some of the design choices assumed by
masonclj.

NOTE: "Agent" in these documents refers to agents in the agent-based
modeling sense.  This sense of the term has almost nothing to do
with the Clojure language agent concept.
