<p><em>Example</em> is a simple MASON model written in Clojure to
illustrate use of the masonclj library.  The agents here are
called "snipes".  Snipes run around in an environment and don't do
anything else.</p>

<p>The following parameters for model runs can be set in the Model tab:
<table style="width:100%"><tr><td valign=top>NumSnipes:</td> <td>Size of snipe population</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>MaxEnergy:</td> <td>Maximum energy level for snipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvWidth:</td> <td>Width of env.  Must be an even number.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvHeight:</td> <td>Height of env. Must be an even number.</td></tr>
</table>
