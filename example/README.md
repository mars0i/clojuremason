<a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview:</h2>

<em>example</em> is a simple MASON model written in Clojure using the
masonclj library.  It's a stripped down version of a full-fledged model named
"pasta", and I have kept some of the names from pasta.  (That way, if you
want to look at pasta as an example of a more full-fledged Clojure MASON
model, it might be a little bit easier after understanding this model.)

<p>The agents here are called "snipes", or more specifically `RSnipes`.
They're defined in snipes.clj.</p>

<p>Snipes run around in an environment and don't do anything else.  The
snipe behavior is implemented in popenv.clj.  ("Popenv" means
population-environment; it is the combination of the population and its
environment. In pasta, the environment contains mushrooms, and snipes
and mushrooms interact; snipes eat mushrooms.)</p>

<p>The main MASON control file is Sim.clj, which subclasses MASON's
`SimState` class.  Another important file is `UI.clj`, which
controles the GUI; this subclasses MASON's `GUIState`.</p>

<p>The usual entry point is neither Sim.clj nor UI.clj,
although both contain `main` methods.  The entry point is a traditional
one for Clojure: core.clj.  This file determines whether the main in Sim.clj
or the one for the GUI in UI.clj is called.  (You don't have to set
up things this way, but that's how I did it.)</p>

<a name="parameters"></a><h2>Parameters:</h2>

The following parameters for model runs can be set in the Model tab.
(This HTML table is from the file gui_vars_table.html that is
automatically generated by `masonclj.params/defparams`.)

<table style="width:100%"><tr><td valign=top>NumRSnipes:</td> <td>Size of r-snipe subpopulation</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>BirthThreshold:</td> <td>Energy level at which birth takes place</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>CarryingProportion:</td> <td>Snipes are randomly culled when number exceed this times # of cells in a subenv (east or west).</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvWidth:</td> <td>Width of env.  Must be an even number.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvHeight:</td> <td>Height of env. Must be an even number.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>ExtremePref:</td> <td>Absolute value of r-snipe preferences.</td></tr>
</table>
