<a name="overview"></a><h2>Overview:</h2>

<em>Example</em> is a relatively simple MASON model written in Clojure
using the masonclj library.

Although Example does nothing but cause little triangles to run around
on a (hexagonal) grid, some of the code is a little more complicated
than it needs to be.  I'm not sure whether this is ideal, but I also
want to make available a full-fledged illustration of a MASON model using and
masonclj; that is in my [pasta](https://github.com/mars0i/pasta) repo.
Example is in fact a stripped-down version of pasta, so that once you
understand Example, it will be easier to see what's going on in pasta.
(Let me know if you feel that I have made Example too difficult to
understand.)

<p>The agents here are called "snipes",  They're defined in
snipes.clj. Snipes run around in an environment and don't do anything
else.  The snipe behavior is implemented in popenv.clj.  ("Popenv"
means population-environment; it is the combination of the population
and its environment. In pasta, the environment contains mushrooms, and
snipes and mushrooms interact; snipes eat mushrooms.)</p>

<p>The main MASON control file is Sim.clj, which subclasses MASON's
`SimState` class.  Another important file is `GUI.clj`, which
controles the GUI; this subclasses MASON's `GUIState`.</p>

<p>The usual entry point is neither Sim.clj nor GUI.clj, although both
contain `main` methods.  The entry point is a traditional one for
Clojure: core.clj.  This file determines whether the main in Sim.clj or
the one for the GUI in GUI.clj is called.  (You don't have to set up
things this way, but that's how I did it.)</p>

<a name="parameters"></a><h2>Parameters:</h2>

The following parameters for model runs can be set in the Model tab.
(This HTML table is from the file gui_vars_table.html that is
automatically generated by `masonclj.params/defparams`.)

<table style="width:100%"><tr><td valign=top>NumSnipes:</td> <td>Size of snipe population</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>MaxEnergy:</td> <td>Maximum energy level for snipes.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvWidth:</td> <td>Width of env.  Must be an even number.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>EnvHeight:</td> <td>Height of env. Must be an even number.</td></tr>
</table>
