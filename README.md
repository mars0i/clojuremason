masonclj
===

A very small library that provides functions and macros that smooth a
few rough edges to using MASON in Clojure.  (The rough edges are due to
reasonable design choices by the architects of both Clojure and MASON.)

## Usage

1. Add a dependency to `mars0i/masonclj "0.1.0"` (or whatever is the latest
version number in project.clj or pom.xml here).  For example, if you are
using Leingingen, add `[mars0i/masonclj "0.1.0"]` to the
`:dependencies` vector in project.clj.

2. See the
[README](https://github.com/mars0i/masonclj/blob/master/doc/README.md)
in the **doc** directory for detailed information on what masonclj
provides and how to use it.
